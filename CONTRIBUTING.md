# Contributing to Temporal Trading Agents

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project!

## Contributor Assignment Agreement (CAA)

Before we can accept your contributions, you must sign a Contributor Assignment Agreement (CAA). This agreement assigns copyright of your contributions to Unidatum Integrated Products LLC while granting you a perpetual license to use your contributions.

### Why a CAA?

The CAA allows us to:
- Maintain clear ownership of the codebase
- Enforce the AGPLv3 license effectively
- Offer commercial licenses to companies that cannot release their source code
- Protect the project and its users legally
- Make future licensing decisions if needed

**Note on Commercial Licensing**: This project is dual-licensed. While it's freely available under AGPLv3, we also offer commercial licenses to companies that need to use the software in closed-source projects. Copyright assignment through the CAA enables us to offer these commercial licenses, which helps fund ongoing development while keeping the open-source version freely available.

### How to Sign the CAA

1. Download the CAA template: [CONTRIBUTOR_AGREEMENT.md](./CONTRIBUTOR_AGREEMENT.md)
2. Fill in your information
3. Sign and date the agreement
4. Email the signed agreement to: legal@unidatum.com

Alternatively, for electronic signatures:
- Send an email from your primary email address to legal@unidatum.com with the subject "CAA Agreement - [Your Name]" and include the filled-out agreement in the body
